# Atari-PPO

This project implements vanilla policy gradient on Arcade Learning Environment with Tensorflow 2.0.

### how to train

train the model with the following command

```Python
./train_ppo.py
```

The trained model will be under model directory

### how to test

test the model with the following command

```Python
./test_ppo.py
```

### to do

the KL divergence in the objective function of PPO has not been implemented in the code. I will add it soon.
